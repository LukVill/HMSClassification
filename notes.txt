so far, the train csv has the input and output i need to work with

the problem is that with each patient, they have an eeg and a spectrogram

how the experts did it is that they looked at a specific combinations of eeg and spectrogram for each
patient and judged it

different scores came up for each separate pair of eeg/spec

train csv contains patient id, their eeg/spec id combo, and classification

NOTES:
eeg is sampled 200 rows per second
spec is sampled 

TODO 
figure out how to put samples of eeg and spec into train csv (row observation frequencies are diff)

Tasks:
1. remove observations in train csv that are outlier classifications
(i.e. if majority of observations on patient are A, then remove all that are not A)

2. modify all eegs to have a col stating the id of the eeg

|eeg id|Fp1|F3|...

3. modify all specs to have a col stating the id of the spec

|spec id| time | LL_0.59| ...

4. sample (via strata = consensus) train.csv and then for each eeg/spec, column bind the respective parquet
data

5. join dataframes
train csv + eeg ON eeg_id
train csv + spec ON spec_id and 

modeling tips:
normalize all values to be within the same range
